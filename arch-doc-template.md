## 🏛️ Structure

### 1. 🎯 Problem Statement and Context

The problem is to enable a global audience to vote in real time during a Live TV Show. Key challenges include handling enormous, short-lived traffic spikes from a user base of hundreds of millions, guaranteeing each registered viewer can cast exactly one vote, and ensuring no votes are lost even under failures. At the same time, the system must prevent bots and bad actors from skewing results, provide near real time aggregated results for on-air presentation, and keep an audit trail for post-event review.

### 2. 🎯 Goals

1. Data Integrity & Durability - exactly-once voting, zero data loss, cross-AZ replication
2. Performance & Scale - handle up to 300M users and 250k RPS peak load
3. Low Latency - p99 <150 ms write, <200 ms read, UI refresh <1 s
4. Security & Anti-Fraud - duplicate vote prevention, bot mitigation, rate limiting, CAPTCHA
5. Observability & Auditability - end-to-end tracing, immutable logs, metrics, dashboards
6. Fault Tolerance - queue-based backpressure, retries, no dropped votes
7. Modular Architecture - independently scalable and replaceable components
8. Cost Efficiency – balance SLA vs operational cost through dynamic scaling
9. Compliance & Privacy - ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance and data anonymization
10. Operational Simplicity - IaC, automated deploys, minimal manual ops

### 3. 🎯 Non-Goals

List in form of bullets what non-goals do have. Here it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Be perfect: There will be mistakes, we dont want have automatic-rollback for everything.
2. DynamoDB: Dynamo is expensive, we want be away from the DB.
3. Serverless: Serverless has high latency, we do not want to use it.
4. Mobile-native: We want have one single codebase, therefore we will not have 2 mobile code bases(ios and android) thefore be native is not a goal.
5. ...
```

### 📐 3. Principles

List in form of bullets what design principles you want to be followed, it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Low Coupling: We need to watch for coupling all times.
2. Flexibility: Users should be able to customize behavior without leaking the internals of the system. Leverage interfaces.
3. Observability: we should expose all key metrics on main features. Sucess and errors counters need to be exposed.
4. Testability: Chaos engineering is a must and property testing. Testing should be done by engineers all times.
5. Cache efficiency: Should leverage SSD caches and all forms of caches as much as possible.
```

### 🏗️ 4. Overall Diagrams

Here there will be a bunch of diagrams, to understand the solution.
```
🗂️ 4.1 Overall architecture: Show the big picture, relationship between macro components.
🗂️ 4.2 Deployment: Show the infra in a big picture. 
🗂️ 4.3 Use Cases: Make 1 macro use case diagram that list the main capability that needs to be covered. 
```

### 🧭 5. Trade-offs

List the tradeoffs analysis, comparing pros and cons for each major decision.
Before you need list all your major decisions, them run tradeoffs on than.
example:
Major Decisions: 
```
1. One mobile code base - should be (...)
2. Reusable capability and low latency backends should be (...)
3. Cache efficiency therefore should do (...)
```
Tradeoffs:
```
1. React Native vs (Flutter and Native)
2. Serverless vs Microservices
3. Redis vs Enbeded Caches
```
Each tradeoff line need to be:
```
PROS (+) 
  * Benefit: Explanation that justify why the benefit is true.
CONS (+)
  * Problem: Explanation that justify why the problem is true.
```
PS: Be careful to not confuse problem with explanation.

### 🌏 6. For each key major component

What is a majore component? A service, a lambda, a important ui, a generalized approach for all uis, a generazid approach for computing a workload, etc...
```
6.1 - Class Diagram              : classic uml diagram with attributes and methods
6.2 - Contract Documentation     : Operations, Inputs and Outputs
6.3 - Persistence Model          : Diagrams, Table structure, partiotioning, main queries.
6.4 - Algorithms/Data Structures : Spesific algos that need to be used, along size with spesific data structures.
```

Exemplos of other components: Batch jobs, Events, 3rd Party Integrations, Streaming, ML Models, ChatBots, etc...

### 🖹 7. Migrations

IF Migrations are required describe the migrations strategy with proper diagrams, text and tradeoffs.

### 🖹 8. Testing strategy

Explain the techniques, principles, types of tests and will be performaned, and spesific details how to mock data, stress test it, spesific chaos goals and assumptions.

### 🖹 9. Observability strategy

Explain the techniques, principles,types of observability that will be used, key metrics, what would be logged and how to design proper dashboards and alerts.

### 🖹 10. Data Store Designs

For each different kind of data store i.e (Postgres, Memcached, Elasticache, S3, Neo4J etc...) describe the schemas, what would be stored there and why, main queries, expectations on performance. Diagrams are welcome but you really need some dictionaries.

### 🖹 11. Technology Stack

Describe your stack, what databases would be used, what servers, what kind of components, mobile/ui approach, general architecture components, frameworks and libs to be used or not be used and why.
